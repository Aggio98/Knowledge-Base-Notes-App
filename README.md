# Knowledge Base / Notes App 

The project is built to refresh and demonstrate full-stack fundamentals with a strong focus on clean architecture, security, and maintainability.

## A personal notes application where a user can:
- Register and log in
- Create, read, update, and delete notes
- Organize notes with optional tags or categories
- Search through their notes

Think of it as a mini Notion / Evernote for yourself.

# Why This Project
